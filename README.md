## üîç Project Overview

This project is a PHP-based system designed to manage email unsubscription requests. Users can unsubscribe from mailing lists, and the system logs these requests for record-keeping and compliance purposes. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into existing applications.

## üìÇ Files

### 1. `unsub.php`
Handles the logic for processing unsubscribe requests and logs relevant information into a file for audit purposes.

### 2. `index.html`
A simple front-end form that allows users to enter their email addresses and submit a request to unsubscribe from email lists.

### 3. `unsubscribe.log`
A log file that tracks each unsubscription event, including the email address, timestamp, and IP address of the request.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ronknight/unsubscribe-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd unsubscribe-system
   ```

3. Start the PHP server (if you're using PHP's built-in server):
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to access the system.

## üìù Usage

1. Open the form in your browser (`index.html`).
2. Enter the email address you want to unsubscribe from your mailing list.
3. Submit the form, and the system will log the unsubscription event.

## üìú Logs

The `unsubscribe.log` file contains records of every unsubscription request processed by the system. Each entry includes:
- The user's email address
- The timestamp of the request
- The IP address from which the request was made

## üìä Visualization

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Submits Email] -->|Form Submission| B[unsub.php]
    B --> C{Valid Email?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Process Unsubscribe]
    D --> E[Log Unsubscription Event]
    C -- No --> F[Display Error]
    E --> G[Store in unsubscribe.log]
```

The flowchart above demonstrates the process of how the unsubscribe system operates:

1. The user submits their email address via the form.
2. The system checks if the email is valid.
3. If valid, it processes the unsubscription and logs the event. If not, an error message is displayed.
